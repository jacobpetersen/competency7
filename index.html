                    <p class="label">‚≠ê Site Favorite!</p>
                    <p>While Spain loves to take credit for the creation of the Cortado, those who know, know that the drink
                    was perfected right here in America at a little place called Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco, CA.
                    It was at this mystical little coffee shop that Steve Ford began serving the 1:1 ratio of espresso to steamed
                    milk drink not as a weak single shot drink in a wire handled espresso glass like his European brethren would,
                    but as bold and beautiful double shot in a hefty Gibraltar glass. From this glass, the drink adopted it's off
                    menu name of "Gibraltar" at the shop. From it's humble beginnings to cult favorite, this site's favorite coffee
                    drink can now be found across the country, and even the world, often served in a Gibraltar glass and
                    decorated with a heart shaped foam art, just as Steve would have done it.</p>

                <p>Bitter and powerful this drink is straight to the point, made by simply forcing pressurized hot water through finely ground coffee beans and adding nothing else.</p>

                <p>Similar in size and ingredients to a European style cortado, the only thing differentiating this drink is that instead of steamed milk it uses foam milk.</p>
